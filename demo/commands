# This demo operates over the example test rigs in the batfish repository.
# It assumes that it is being run from the top-level directory in the repository.

# Do this first, so you have the relevant shell commands
# % source tools/batfish_function.sh

# Select one of the two options below
## If you want to run analysis locally
## % allinone -runmode interactive
#
## If you want to run against www.batfish.org
## % batfish_client -runmode interactive

# load the testing 
init-testrig test_rigs/example

#####################
# our logical representation of the network that can be queried in various ways. 
# we have many queries and can write more

# for example, we can ask simple questions on adjacencies
get neighbors 
# --> can help ensure that adjacencies are as expected (i.e., interfaces are properly configured)

# we can also ask for protocol-level adjacencies 
get neighbors neighborType=["ebgp"]
# --> can help ensure that protocol sessions are configured correctly

##############
# we can also do other simple checks based on best practices of our network

# this will check if all interface ips are unique
get uniqueipassignments

# this will check if all loopbacks are being correctly announced within OSPF
get ospfloopbacks

################
# more interestingly, we can also ask questions about data flow, i.e., the end-to-end impact of all configuration

# for example, we can see how host1 reaches a particular IP address 
# the query will take time if the dataplane has not been comptued before
get #traceroute host1 1.0.2.2
# (the macro above expands to "get traceroute ingressNode=host1 | dstIp=1.0.2.2")
# --> unlike a regular traceroute we show multipath and interface information

# suppose host1 (2.128.0.101) is running DNS and we want to ensure that the server is reachable 
# can easily do this using protocol-specific traceroutes
get #traceroute as2border1 2.128.0.101 dns

################
# while the above could be done using testing/emulation, we alone can be comprehensive 

# for example, find *all* (starting node, packet header) combinations where the DNS server is unreachable
get #checkreachability 2.128.0.101 dns
# (macro expands to "get reachability dstPrefixes=["2.128.0.101/32"] | dstPortRange=["53-53"] | ipProtoRange=["17-17"] | actions=["drop"])
# --> the output shows outsiders with spoofed source addresses cannot reach the DNS server (good)
# --> but also shows that a bad ACL on host2 is blocking access (bad)

# another example: host2 (2.128.1.101) is running SSH. we can run similar queries to learn who cannot reach it
# but we can also ensure that non-ssh traffic can *never* reach host2 
get #checkprotection 2.128.1.101 !ssh
# --> all good! hard to guarantee with testing but easy for us

# another example: we also want to ensure that outsiders can *never* reach the SSH server
# we have ACLs on as2's border routers to prevent this. to test that things are correctly implemented:
get #checkprotection 2.128.1.101 ssh as(1|3)border1
# --> buggy ACL on as2border2!

#############
# comparing two sets of configs (e.g., current + planned) is a powerful debugging aid

# initialize the delta environment and generate its dataplane
init-delta-environment test_rigs/example-with-delta

# any earlier query can be executed differentially, to see if how behavior differs
get neighbors differential=true

# a particularly powerful query: reachability diff between the two environments
get reachability type=reduced
# --> any collateral damage is easy to see

#############
# fault-tolerance can be ensured in a similar manner by studying the impact of failures

# this command creates a network view after an interface failure
get environmentcreation interfaceBlacklist=[{hostname=as2border2,interface="FastEthernet0/0"}]

# we can see if reachability changes at all after this failure
get reachability type=reduced
# --> any lack of fault tolerance is easy to see

##############
# finally, sanity checking can be done in the data plane too (e.g., valley-free routing in the DC, number of hops)

# a powerful example: multipath consistency. 
get reachability type=multipath
# --> will catch hard-to-debug, bad interactions between routing and ACLs
