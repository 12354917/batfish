**************************************************
Cygwin: Read README.CYGWIN before continuing
OSX: Read README.OSX before continuing


Common Prerequisites:
   ant
   Java 8 JDK
   Network Logic Solver (nls) (not required for all tasks)
   python
   z3

Optional:
   JProfiler - a Java profiler - located at http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html

Steps:
NOTE: After any step involving modifications to .bashrc or equivalent, make sure to reload your shell or take other action to load the changes.

1. Install gnu parallel 20150109 or later from https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/
standard autotools install (extract, configure, make, make install)

2. Install z3 - use master branch
git clone https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3
cd z3
python scripts/mk_make.py --java
cd build
make -j<number-of-jobs>
make install # as administrator (sudo or whatever)

3. Install nls into your path
   You can download the Windows version from: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52259

4. Clone batfish
git clone https://github.com/arifogel/batfish.git

5. prepare your environment for batfish by adding the following to your .bashrc or equivalent
    . <batfish-root>/tools/batfish_functions.sh
Sourcing batfish_functions.sh will give your shell access to batfish functions. You may prefer to source it manually if you do not want to clutter up your environment in every interactive bash session.

6. compile batfish
   batfish_build_all
Note that 'batfish_build_all' runs 'ant' in each batfish project directory with corresponding args.
You can clean all generated output with:
   batfish_build_all distclean

7. Tests
From the root of the batfish repository, run:
allinone -cmdfile tests/commands

8. Demo
From the root of the batfish repository, run:
allinone -cmdfile demo/commands

9. Now what?
To get an interactive batfish prompt to play around with, run:
   allinone -runmode interactive
This will start batfish service locally in a self-contained fashion
You can read read README.client for example commands to use
